# 🔐 OTP Login Frontend

**otploginfrontend** is a modern web application built using the [React Native]([https://nextjs.org/](https://reactnative.dev/)) framework. It is designed to interact with a FastAPI backend and a PostgreSQL database for secure OTP-based authentication.

> ⚠️ This repository currently contains setup and documentation. Source code will be added soon.


## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a user-friendly and secure **OTP login system** where:
- Users can request a One-Time Password (OTP)
- The OTP is sent via email or SMS (handled by the backend)
- Users can use the OTP to log in securely

This frontend will:
- Be built using **React Native**
- Make API calls to a **FastAPI** backend
- Display interactive login flows
- Follow best practices for responsive and accessible UI
